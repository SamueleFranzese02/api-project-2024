# Bakery Order Management Simulation

## Description
This project simulates the operation of an industrial bakery's order management system using a discrete-time model. Each event in the simulation occurs at specific time steps, ensuring a structured and sequential processing of operations. The bakery must efficiently manage ingredients, recipes, and customer orders while handling restocking and courier shipments.
